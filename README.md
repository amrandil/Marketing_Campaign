# Customer Personality Analysis - Clustering Project

## Project by Amr Kandil & Joseph Emad

## Project Overview
This project performs Customer Personality Analysis using various clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors, demographics, and interactions with the company's promotional campaigns. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs of different customer groups.

## Problem Statement
Customer personality analysis helps businesses modify their products and marketing strategies based on customer segments, improving efficiency by targeting the right customer groups rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach. The goal of this project is to segment customers based on a variety of demographic, behavioral, and purchase-related features using different clustering techniques.

## Dataset
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis/data]

The dataset consists of customer data from a company, with features such as:

Demographic Information: Birth year, marital status, education level, household income, etc.
Purchase Behavior: Amount spent on different products over the past two years.
Promotional Responses: Participation in marketing campaigns.
Engagement Metrics: Web and store purchases, catalog orders, and website visits.
Attributes

People: Customer's ID, birth year, education, marital status, income, household composition, enrollment date, recency, and complaints.
Products: Amount spent on wines, fruits, meat, fish, sweets, and gold products in the last two years.
Promotions: Responses to marketing campaigns and the number of discounted purchases.
Purchases & Visits: Web purchases, catalog purchases, store purchases, and web visits.

## Clustering Techniques
We explored and compared several clustering techniques based on different assumptions about the dataset:

1. Hierarchical Clustering

2. Partitioning (Distance from Centroid)

3. Density-Based Clustering

4. Fuzzy Clustering

5. Distribution Models


## Evaluation
The performance of each clustering technique was evaluated and compared using metrics like:

- Silhouette Score
- Inertia (for K-Means)
- Visualizations of Cluster Assignments
